# Procrastinate Pro+ Marketing Analysis

Welcome to the Procrastinate Pro+ marketing analysis project! Despite significant investments in advertising, this entertainment app has been struggling financially over the past few months. As a marketing analyst, our task is to uncover the root causes of these losses and provide actionable recommendations to improve the app's profitability.

This project involves a detailed examination of three datasets:

1. **Server Visit Logs**: Information about user visits to the application.
2. **Orders**: Data about user purchases and revenue generated.
3. **Advertising Costs**: Information on marketing expenses across various channels.

The analysis focuses on:

- Understanding user demographics, device preferences, and traffic sources.
- Evaluating customer acquisition costs (CAC) by channel.
- Assessing the lifetime value (LTV) of users.
- Determining the return on investment (ROI) for advertising efforts.
- Identifying factors hindering effective customer acquisition.

Using Python for data analysis and visualization, this project aims to provide insights that drive strategic marketing decisions.

### Goals:
- Pinpoint inefficiencies in user acquisition strategies.
- Evaluate the profitability and sustainability of advertising campaigns.
- Provide actionable recommendations to optimize marketing efforts.

Feel free to explore the provided scripts and insights in this repository. Your contributions and feedback are welcome!
