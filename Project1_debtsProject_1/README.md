# Analysis of Borrower Reliability

## Overview
This project aims to analyze how a client's marital status and the number of children they have affect their ability to repay loans on time. The insights from this research will be used to improve the credit scoring model for a bank's credit department. A more accurate credit scoring model helps financial institutions minimize risks and make informed lending decisions.

## Objective
The primary objective is to determine whether factors such as family size and marital status are significant predictors of loan repayment reliability. The results will help enhance the bank's risk assessment processes.

## Dataset Description
The dataset contains information on clients' solvency and includes the following columns:

- `children`: Number of children in the family.
- `days_employed`: Total work experience in days.
- `dob_years`: Age of the client in years.
- `education`: Level of education.
- `education_id`: Identifier for education level.
- `family_status`: Marital status of the client.
- `family_status_id`: Identifier for marital status.
- `gender`: Gender of the client.
- `income_type`: Employment type.
- `debt`: Indicates if the client had overdue loan payments (1 for yes, 0 for no).
- `total_income`: Monthly income of the client.
- `purpose`: Purpose of the loan.

## Tools and Techniques
- **Python**: Data analysis and visualization.
- **Pandas**: Data cleaning and processing.
- **Matplotlib/Seaborn**: Data visualization.
- **Statistical Analysis**: To identify significant predictors.

## Goals
1. Understand the relationship between marital status, family size, and loan repayment behavior.
2. Identify trends and patterns in the data.
3. Provide actionable insights to improve the bank's credit scoring model.

## Outcome
The findings from this project will be incorporated into the bank's credit scoring system to better predict a client's ability to repay loans, enhancing the reliability of lending decisions.
